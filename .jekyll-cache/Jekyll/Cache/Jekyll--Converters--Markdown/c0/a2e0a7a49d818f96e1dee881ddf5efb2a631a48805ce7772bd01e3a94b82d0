I"^<p>My name is Griffin. I currently live in Brooklyn, New York and work remotely as a user-interface designer for a company in California. I’ve created this blog to log things I am reading and thinking about as I consider a next stage in my life.</p>

<p>In particular I hope to share findings in the subjects of designing shelter, decentralism and degrowth, and the pursuit of self-sufficiency. Living off-grid has been a personal interest of mine since my early 20s (now 31). I’ve done a fair bit of reading on the subject, but living in New York City has prevented me from any actual experience.</p>
