I"ä<p>My name is Griffin. I currently live in Brooklyn, New York and work remotely as a user-interface designer for a company in California. Iâ€™ve created this blog to log things I am reading and thinking about as I consider a next stage in my life.</p>

<p>In particular I hope to share findings in the subjects of designing shelter, decentralism and degrowth, and the pursuit of self-sufficiency. Living off-grid has been a personal interest of mine since my early 20s (now 31 years old). Iâ€™ve done a fair bit of reading on the subject, but living in New York City has prevented me from accruing any actual experience.</p>

<p>I am writing this during the COVID-19 pandemic which has essentially put the planet on lockdown. This development has reinforced for me the critical importance of self-relianceâ€“ a concept we in the United States and in similar nations have moved dangerously far from. Perhaps not entirely by our own design, but through the coercive force of industrialization.</p>
