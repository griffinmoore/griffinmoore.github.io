<p>My partner, María Elena, and I visited <a href="https://www.earthshipglobal.com">Earthship Biotecture</a> in Taos, New Mexico about two weeks ago. Unfortunately we had just a day and a half there before COVID-19 urged our early return to New York, but it was still a great experience. We stayed in a <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/22567280">small recently-built studio-layout Earthship</a> that can be rented out.</p>

<p>Earthships seem to be quite well known these days. I’m not sure when I first learned about them, but I bought Michael Reynolds’ three volume book set on eBay just last year after María Elena began research for a tangentially related project and developed her own interest. The books are actually <a href="https://www.earthshipglobal.com/books">on sale</a> now for just $15 a piece– cheaper than I found them on eBay. And earlier this year we watched <a href="http://www.garbagewarrior.com">Garbage Warrior</a> which documents Michael Reynolds’ quest to establish a legal test site for experimental shelter.</p>
