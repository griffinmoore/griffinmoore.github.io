<p>My partner, MarÃ­a Elena, and I visited <a href="https://www.earthshipglobal.com">Earthship Biotecture</a> in Taos, New Mexico two weeks ago. Unfortunately we had just a day and a half there before COVID-19 urged our early return to New York, but it was still a great experience.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not sure when I first learned about Earthships, but I bought Michael Reynoldsâ€™ three volume book set on eBay just last year. The books are actually <a href="https://www.earthshipglobal.com/books">on sale</a> now for just $15 a pieceâ€“ cheaper than I found them on eBay. And earlier this year we watched <a href="http://www.garbagewarrior.com">Garbage Warrior</a> which documents Michael Reynoldsâ€™ quest to establish a legal test site for experimental shelters.</p>

<p>We stayed one night in a small studio-layout Earthship.</p>
