I"H<p>My name is Griffin Moore. I currently live in Brooklyn, New York and work remotely as a user-interface designer for a company in California. I’ve created this blog to log different things I am reading and thinking about as I consider the next stage in my life.</p>

<p>In particular I hope to share findings in the subjects of designing shelter, decentralism and degrowth, and the pursuit of self-sufficiency. Living off-grid has been a personal interest of mine since my early 20s (now 31 years old). I’ve done a fair bit of reading on the subject, but living in New York City has prevented me from accruing any actual experience. So I am just a student and that is the tone I wish to communicate.</p>

<p>I am writing this during the COVID-19 pandemic which has essentially put the planet on lockdown. This development has reinforced for me the critical importance of self-reliance– a concept we in the United States and in similar nations have moved dangerously far from. Perhaps not entirely by our own design, but spurred on by the coercive force of industrialization.</p>

<p>Of course, industrialization and standardization have afforded us several luxuries. It’s one thing to design a life within an industrial society– benefitting from the incredible access to goods and services– but can the system be redesigned in a way to meet a good standard of comfort while respecting all people and planet? Undoubtedly it will require change. How we source energy, how we eat, how we build, and how we travel are all, in this moment, performed without adequate consideration of the whole.</p>
