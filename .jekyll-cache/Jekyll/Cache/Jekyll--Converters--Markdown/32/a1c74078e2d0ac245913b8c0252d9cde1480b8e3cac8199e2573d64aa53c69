I"ç<p>My name is Griffin. I currently live in Brooklyn, New York and work remotely as a user-interface designer for a company in California. Iâ€™ve created this blog to log things I am reading and thinking about as I consider a next stage in my life.</p>

<p>In particular I hope to share findings in the subjects of designing shelter, decentralism and degrowth, and the pursuit of self-sufficiency. Beyond these fields, I may also share my enthusiasm for typeface design and veganism.</p>
