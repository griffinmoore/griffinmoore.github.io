<meta name="description" content="Earthship is a type of house built with natural and recycled materials with energy conservation in mind. It is designed to produce water, electricity, and food for its own use. My partner, María Elena, and I visited Earthship Biotecture in Taos, New Mexico about two weeks ago. Unfortunately we had just a day and a half there before COVID-19 urged our early return to New York, but it was still a great experience. We stayed in a small recently-built studio-layout Earthship that can be rented out. The drive from our previous stay in Santa Fe was quite barren so when we finally arrived alongside the Earthship community it actually felt surreal. We had seen the buildings online and on film, but seeing them firsthand felt markedly different. I’m not one for New Age aesthetics or the bohemian, crystal type stuff which Earthships can sometimes espouse, but in this strange desert context it seemed more acceptable. Still, I appreciated our rental being styled more traditionally! An Earthship has one wall of windows and three walls of earth-packed tires enclosed in adobe or a similar material. The floor and walls act as thermal mass, storing solar heat entering throughout the day to be naturally released when the home’s air temperature falls. Water is captured from the roof and used three times before returning to the landscape: first by showers and sinks, then indoor plants, then to toilets for flushing. Earthships seem to be quite well known these days. I’m not sure when I first learned about them, but I bought Michael Reynolds’ three volume book set on eBay just last year after María Elena began research for a tangentially related project and developed her own interest. The books are actually on sale now for just $15 a piece– cheaper than I found them on eBay. And earlier this year we watched Garbage Warrior which documents Michael Reynolds’ quest to establish a legal test site for experimental shelter." />
