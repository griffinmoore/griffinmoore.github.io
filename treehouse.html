        The app retained a rating of at least 4.8 stars in the App Store during active development and was featured on various App Store highlights. Users commonly expressed that the iOS apps were preferable to the web app.

        We also built a standalone app for reviewing HTML. Since I was responsible for the content as well, we were able to better suit it to the device– producing custom keyboards to simplify the input of special characters.
