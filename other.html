        Below is a mobile app I have been designing to test an idea for a locality-based social network. The aim is to provide greater utility than current platforms, justifying membership dues for features like tool-sharing, networking, surfacing nearby events and causes– generally creating a greater sense of local community.

        This project is a work-in-progress and just a proof of concept relating to some personal interests of mine such as degrowth, decentralism, and bioregionalism.

        I began designing typefaces in 2009 and would sell my amateur creations under the name Pilgrim Fonts. By 2020, I felt my designs had reached a different standard and I rebranded as Monolith Foundry. I built the shop app myself using Ruby on Rails and continue to maintain it.
