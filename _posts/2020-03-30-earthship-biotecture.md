My partner, María Elena, and I visited [Earthship Biotecture](https://www.earthshipglobal.com) in Taos, New Mexico two weeks ago. Unfortunately we had just a day and a half there before COVID-19 urged our early return to New York, but it was still a great experience.

I'm not sure when I first learned about Earthships, but I bought Michael Reynolds' three volume book set on eBay just last year. The books are actually [on sale](https://www.earthshipglobal.com/books) now for just $15 a piece– cheaper than I found them on eBay. And earlier this year we watched [Garbage Warrior](http://www.garbagewarrior.com) which documents Michael Reynolds' quest to establish a legal test site for experimental shelters.

We stayed one night in a small studio-layout Earthship.
