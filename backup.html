        <p>Differentiated from the core CX product which offers users a set of established survey models, Delighted Surveys was built as a general purpose survey tool.</p>
        <p>As the sole designer, I collaborated with the CEO and three Product Managers to define the feature set, interface, and aesthetic.</p>

        <p>Work began on the survey building process as that served as the foundation of the entire product. I quickly realized an all-in-one editor felt overwhelming and unlike our CX app which progressively exposed certain features.</p>
        <p>My proposal was establishing the question as the modular unit. Questions would be added one-by-one, allowing singular focus and proper visibility into our settings.</p>

        <p>As the mobile designer at Treehouse, I was tasked with translating our core web app to iOS devices. In this process I worked alongside an iOS engineer. Together we established our own roadmap and produced an app which greatly simplified what existed on web.</p>
